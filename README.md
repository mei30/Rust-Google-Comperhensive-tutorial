# Rust-Google-course
Some of rust training in my the journey to learning rust programming languages. this course is going to go forward based on google comperhensive rust tutorial https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/.

## Course Outline:
Fundamentals of:
  * Android: a half-day course on using Rust for Android platform development (AOSP). This includes interoperability with C, C++, and Java.
  * Bare-metal: a full day class on using Rust for bare-metal (embedded) development. Both microcontrollers and application processors are covered.
  * Concurrency: a full day class on concurrency in Rust. We cover both classical concurrency (preemptively scheduling using threads and mutexes) and async/await concurrency (cooperative multitasking using futures).
